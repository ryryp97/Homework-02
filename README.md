# Homework-02

This repository was created to practice the utilization of Bootstrap components and grid system, it also doubles as a live on the web "About Me" page where I can put personal information about myself.

The site can be reached here: [About Me Webpage](https://ryryp97.github.io/Homework-02/)

## Usage

The webpage is responsive, it will adjust its formatting depending on viewport size (try it out!).  The links in the navigation bar direct to different webpages of the website when clicked on (contact will direct to a page that allows inputs, portfolio directs to a page with photos of me and my family, and about directs to the home page).

## Credits

I'd like to thank the documentation guides on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) website, they were a big help in the proper utilization of Bootstrap.
